A Node.js and browser library for interacting with the Wilma API. <br>Use this simple and secure library to create your own Wilma enabled applications!

#### (Library still in development, do not use in production)

# Installation 
## Node.js
This Node.js module is not yet available through the npm registry, since it is still heavily in the developement phase and not stable.

Before installing, download and install Node.js. 

Installation is done using the npm install command, which in our case pulls the module from the GitHub:

```
$ npm install OpenWilma/openwilma_js
```

## Browser
Download this repository as a whole folder to your site.

# Quick Start
Make sure you have imported OpenWilma to your project based on your platform using the following instructions.

For Node.js, do:
```js
const OpenWilma = require('openwilma');
```
For browsers, do (make sure to correct the path, if needed):
```html
<script src="/OpenWilma/OpenWilma.js"></script>
```

Next, check `test.js` or `test.html` for the latest working examples.
